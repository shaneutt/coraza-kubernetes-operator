# Coraza Kubernetes Operator

[Web Application Firewall (WAF)] support for [Kubernetes] [Gateways].

## About

The Coraza Kubernetes Operator (CKO) enables declarative management of [Web
Application Firewalls (WAF)] on Kubernetes clusters. Users can deploy
firewall engines which are attached to gateways, and rules which those
engines enforce.

[Coraza] is used as the firewall engine.

### Key Features

- `Engine` API - declaratively manage WAF instances
- `RuleSet` API - declaratively manage firewall rules
- [ModSecurity Seclang] compatibility

### Supported Integrations

The operator integrates with other tools to attach WAF instances to
their gateways/proxies:

- `istio` - Istio integration ✅ **Currently Supported (ingress Gateway only)**
- `wasm` - WebAssembly deployment ✅ **Currently Supported**

> **Note**: Only Istio+WASM is supported currently.

### Architecture

The CKO's ruleset controller responds to `RuleSet` resources by validating and
compiling the rules (e.g. list of `ConfigMap` resources containing the
[Seclang] rules), which gets emitted to the `RuleSet` cache.

> **Note**: Currently, only [Seclang] rules are supported.

The keys for the cache are the `namespace/name` of the `RuleSet`, allowing the
compiled set of rules to be polled from a cache server hosting the cache.

> **Note**: All `RuleSets` and rules are restricted to same-namespace
> currently.

The engine controller responds to `Engine` resources by deploying the Coraza
engine according to the type and mode provided, and attaching it to a `Gateway`.

> **Note**: For example: if the type is `istio` and the mode is `wasm`, it
> will attach Coraza to an Istio `Gateway`, loading it via a [WASM] module.

`Engine` resources target a `RuleSet` to indicate the firewall rules that will
be applied to all `Gateway` traffic. Poll intervals for `RuleSets` can be set
to enable automatic and live rule updates on running `Engines`.
